# Who Am I?

I am a full-stack developer focused on entering the world of Mobile Development. [I spent five years working](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricktdoyle/) in the tech industry with a healthcare focus. I fell in love with software and decided to explore it deeper by entering the world of software development.  Ever since, I have been teaching myself anything and everything there is to know about coding non-stop.  I have spent the past couple years learning both Android and iOS development and creating various projects.
